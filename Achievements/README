Achievement System: SQLite backend

Contains two main methods:
	-database.Database, which creates a populates a database with users and achievements.
	-Simulation, which simulates n amount of games, in which n is a number input as an argument.
		If there is no argument supplied, then 2000 games are simulated.

Adding an achievement is as simple as adding a name, description, and a set of conditions(attribute,
 comparitive operation, and a number to compare to).
 
Adding a stat involves changes to either the participates or users table, which is based on game and
 global stats, respectively. This also implies changes to methods involved with inserting updating and 
 selecting from the database. The final change must be done in the condition data container class, where
 an else if or switch (depending on jdk version) clause must be added to the getAttribute function.
 
Added a death stat as part of game statistics and added a KDR achievement.
